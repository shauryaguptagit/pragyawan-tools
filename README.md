# Pragyawan Automation Tools

This repository contains two Python-based internal tools developed during my data management internship at Pragyawan Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (Jul-Sept 2025).

## 1. Excel Data Automation Tool

A Python script designed to streamline and automate manual Excel data entry.

* **Problem:** The team was spending significant time manually processing, cleaning, and entering data into Excel spreadsheets.
* **Solution:** This tool uses the **Pandas** library to read, clean, and consolidate data from multiple sources into a single, structured Excel file. This automated the most repetitive parts of the process, reducing manual data entry time by an estimated 40%.
* **Technology:** Python, Pandas

## 2. Tkinter File Distribution Utility

A simple desktop application built to automate repetitive file management tasks for operational staff.

* **Problem:** Staff members were manually copying and moving specific files to designated network folders multiple times per day, which was tedious and prone to human error.
* **Solution:** This utility provides a simple GUI (built with **Tkinter**) where a user can select a source and destination. A single click automates the file distribution process, saving approximately 5 hours of manual work per week.
* **Technology:** Python, Tkinter, `shutil` library
